# How to use
Download the "sly" Python package with ```pip3 install sly```.
Run parser.py with ```python3 parser.py``` in either the terminal or the command line. This program does not support Python 2.7.

After executing successfully, you should see a "> " symbol. Type any query such as ```1 + 1``` or ```test = 20``` to check lexemes and parse queries.
